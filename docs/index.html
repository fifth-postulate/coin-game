        <h1>Coin Game</h1>
        <h2>A present for Linde&apos;s 30<sup>th</sup> birthday</h2>
        <div class="container" data-position="2, 3, 4" data-type="misere"></div>
        <p>
            The <strong>Coin Game</strong> is played by two players, taking
            turns. Each turn a player takes a number of coins from a single row.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the <strong>misere</strong>(☹) game the player that takes the last
            coin loses. In the <strong>normal</strong>(☺) game the player wins when
            she takes the last coin.
        </p>
        <h2>An analysis</h2>
        <p>
            We will analyse the game in order to tell which player will win, and
            how that player should play.
        </p>
        <h3>Known Positions</h3>
        <p>
            We will first analyse some position with great regularity.
        </p>
        <h4>One coin per row</h4>
        <p>
            When each row had only one coin, the only option a player has is to
            take a coin from a row. Therefor the number of rows, determines the
            number of turns that is played. This in turn determines the winner.
        </p>

            This proofs the following theorem.
        </p>
        <div class="theorem">
            <p>
                For a position in which each row has a single coin, the
                following holds.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The first player has a winning strategy when the number of
                    rows is even.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The second player has a winning strategy when the number of
                    rows is odd.

        <h4>One row of coins</h4>
        <p>
            When there is only one row of coins and there are at least two
            coins, the first player has a winning strategy. For she can take all
            but the last coin, leaving the second player with a losing position.
        </p>
        <p>
            This proofs the following theorem.
        </p>
        <div class="theorem">
            <p>
                For a position with only one row the following holds.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    If there is only one coin the first player loses.
                </li>
                <li>
                    For any other number of coins the first player has a winning
                    strategy.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p class="caption">

        <h3>Two rows</h3>
        <p>
            We will spend some time analysing all positions with two rows.
        </p>
        <p>
            We will do this by case analyses. We will designate a position by a
            sequence of integers. For example the
            <tt>2,3</tt> position is demontrated below.
        </p>
        <div class="container" data-position="2, 3" data-type="misere"></div>
        <h4><tt>1,n</tt></h4>
        <p>
            This is a winning position for the first player for she can play to
            <tt>1</tt>.
        </p>
        <h4><tt>n,n</tt></h4>
        <p>
            This is a win for the second player. For what ever the first player
            plays she can either play to <tt>t,t</tt> or she finds herself in
            <tt>1,n</tt>, which is a winning position for her.
        </p>
        <h4><tt>m,n</tt></h4>
        <p>
            This is a win for the first player for she can play to <tt>u,u</tt>,
            where <tt>u</tt> is the minimum of <tt>m</tt> and <tt>n</tt>.
        </p>
        <p class="caption">A winning position for the first player.</p>
        <div class=container data-position="5, 8" data-type="misere"></div>
        <h3>Three rows</h3>
        <p>
            We will leave the three rows positions as an exercise to the reader.
